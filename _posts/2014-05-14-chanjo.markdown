## Intro
Chanjo breaks down coverage to intuitive levels of abstraction; genes, transcripts, exons, and intervals. It also introduces a new coverage metric that reduces the bias from uneven coverage.

Chanjo is built around the idea of multiple levels of pipelines and fully embraces UNIX conventions. It's easily incorporated into existing pipelines and provides a clear path for downstream analysis.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat some_intervals.bed
1  10 15 interval-1
2  45 55 interval-2
$ cat some_intervals.bed | chanjo annotate alignment.bam | tee annotations.bed
#{"sample_id": "bavewira", ...}
1  10 15 interval-1  9.92231     0.97231
2  45 55 interval-2  14.23123 1.0
{% endhighlight %}

## Documentation
The [redesigned documentation][docs] has all the information you want; getting started guide, foolproof installation instructions, and in-depth overviews.

I can specifically recommend the fully [interactive demo][demo], complete with sample data to get you started *right away*.

## Installation
Complete instructions are available in the [documentation][docs] but installation (*can be*) as simple as running:

If you're a [Conda][anaconda] user, begin by installing the required C-extensions:

{% highlight bash %}
$ conda install cython SQLAlchemy numpy
# For Python 2.x users (pip installs pysam for Python 3.x)
$ conda install pysam
{% endhighlight %}

And now for Chanjo:

{% highlight bash %}
$ pip install chanjo
{% endhighlight %}
