# Documentation
The [redesigned documentation](http://www.chanjo.co) has all the information you want; getting started guide, foolproof installation instructions, and in-depth overviews.

I can specifically recommend the fully [interactive demo](http://www.chanjo.co/en/latest/introduction.html#demo), complete with sample data to get you started right away.

# Installation
Complete instructions are available in the [documentation][docs] but installation (*can be*) as simple as running:

{% highlight bash %}
$ pip install chanjo
{% endhighlight %}
