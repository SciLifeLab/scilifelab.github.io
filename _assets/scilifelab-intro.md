## Open Source Projects

### Motivation
To help to foster transparency and co-operation within the academic society, SciLifeLab promotes open-source code practices. Many programmers and bioinformaticians working at SciLifeLab release their code as tools for general use. Such releases demand maintenance and documentation and result in greater productivity of the community.

### Our Open Source Portal
We are curating a list of useful and actively maintained projects at SciLifeLab in our [Open Source Portal][portal]. Expect to find anything from bioinformatics resources and general programming tools to full fledged data analysis pipelines.
