## Open Source Projects

### Motivation
Open source code is released under a licence that allows others to use that code for their own purposes. Releasing code in this way helps to foster transparency and co-operation within the academic society. SciLifeLab benefits from such open source software (for example, all of our servers run open source operating systems) and contributes back to the community by promoting open-source code practices.

### Our Open Source Portal
Many programmers and bioinformaticians working at SciLifeLab release their code as tools for general use. These releases demand maintenance and documentation and result in greater productivity of the community. We are curating a list of useful and actively maintained projects at SciLifeLab in our [Open Source Portal][portal]. You can find code ranging from simple bioinformatics resources and general programming tools right through to complete data analysis pipelines.
