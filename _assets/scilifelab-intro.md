## Open Source Projects

### Motivation
Several programmers and bioinformaticians at SciLifeLab have decieded to publish their code online. Along with that commitment comes a more acute need for proper documentation and continuous maintenance. This effort *deserves* attention.

### Our Open Source Portal
We are curating a list of useful and actively maintained projects at SciLifeLab in our [Open Source Portal][portal]. Expect to find anything from bioinformatics resources and general programming tools to full fledged data analysis pipelines.
